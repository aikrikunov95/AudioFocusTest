Steps to reproduce:

1. In Android Studio, run default emulator "Medium Phone API 35";
2. Run the app
3. Go to OS settings, allow notifications permission and alarms permission
4. Return to the app and press "Setup alarm" button
5. Immediately go to home screen
6. In 10 seconds you will see a notification but hear no sound.

P.S. If you stay in the app instead of going to home screen, you will hear sound.
